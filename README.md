# rlox

---

## What's this?

A toy project for me to learn interpreter and project-level skill of rust.

If you're interested, clone the repo and run

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Then just run the command below to try REPL, or throw a file/script to mess around by add a path.

```bash
./target/release/rlox
```
